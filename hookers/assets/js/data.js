I am Major General Joseph Hooker and it is my great pleasure to introduce Hooker’s House Bourbon: battle-tested bourbon with the smooth sophistication of wine country.  But do not underestimate us!  My bourbon and I are here to disrupt and awaken your dusty wine traditions. ",

Every sip of Hookers House Bourbon should be taken in like an orchestral overture.  Let the warmth and smooth flavor wash over your palette dear drinker, and bask in the glow of the love child of Kentucky and California."
